## Genomic epidemiology of schistosomiasis
Recent advances in sequencing technologies make it increasingly feasible to generate genome-scale data on parasites like schistosomes for use in population-based research and surveillance. In collaboration with the Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention and scientists at the University of Colorado and the University of Texas who have developed an efficient method for sequencing genomes from schistosome miracidia collected in the field, we are using relatedness between parasites to understand why and how S. japonicum persists in residual hot spots of infection in southwest China.

## Agricultural livelihoods and schistosome exposure

For my dissertation research, I worked closely with collaborators at the Centre de Recherche Biomedical – Espoir Pour La Sante, University of California – Santa Barbara and Stanford University to understand how rural and agricultural livelihoods contribute to exposure to schistosome parasites through a variety of water contact activities. I have used household surveys to quantify the relationship between agricultural livelihoods and schistosome infection and combined household survey data with ecological and interview data to understand the relative contributions of social and environmental factors to schistosome risk. I have also used qualitative data derived from focus groups to understand local perspectives of disease and the environment and the experience of living in the dammed and endemic landscape along the Senegal River. Future work in this area will focus on how seasonality influences water contact behavior, how livestock ownership influences human infection risk and assessing the spatial relationships between water sources and human activity space.

## Mitigating disease around dams
My dissertation research on human livelihoods and schistosomiasis was embedded within a larger project that aimed to implement and evaluate an ecological intervention to control schistosomiasis. Our field sites in the lower basin of the Senegal River suffer a high burden of schistosomiasis in part because of a dam constructed in the 1980s. Dams create an ideal habitat for the snails that transmit schistosomiasis: stabilizing water levels, preventing saltwater intrusion and importantly, disrupting the populations of snail predators. Some of these predators – freshwater prawns – migrate downriver to estuaries to reproduce. When dams block this migration, prawns disappear from upstream reaches of the river and leave snail populations to grow unchecked.

Our research shows that almost half of the 800 million people at risk for schistosomiasis globally are at increased risk because dams block the migration of snail predators. Along the Senegal River, my qualitative research showed that people view the dam as beneficial. It improves both food and economic security, but people also recognized that these benefits  come at a cost. Most people recognize that the tell-tale signs of schistosomiasis have become common among themselves and their children. Modeling analyses indicate that prawn aquaculture can sustainably improve food production, reduce schistosome transmission and increase revenues for small-scale subsistence agriculture.

Since 2017, I have also co-led work that explores the potential for other ways to mitigate disease around dams. With an interdisciplinary team of graduate students supported by the [National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)](https://www.sesync.org/), our team  examined how environmental planning in the Senegal River Basin overlooked the health impacts of dam development. We analyzed documents from the river basin authority’s archive to understand how health impacts were framed and prioritized with respect to the traditional objectives of dam development: food, energy, and water resources. By comparing this framing and prioritization across policy, impact assessment and operational documents, we examined whether and how management policies are put into practice. We found that health impacts of dam development were important effects to be mitigated, but proposals to manage dams for disease control have so far not been adopted in practice.

Future work in this area will include empirical analysis of the impact of prawn aquaculture on snail populations and human infection with schistosomes, collaborative work to demonstrate the feasibility of dam management for disease control and eventually field studies to understand the impact of dam management schemes on snail and mosquito ecology as well as human infection risk.

## Spatial ecology of schistosome transmission
In collaboration with colleagues at Stanford University, University of Washington and Centre de Recherche Biomedical – Espoir Pour La Sante, I contributed to research on the spatial ecology of schistosome transmission along the lower basin of the Senegal River. This work  involved the use of light unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) to identify and sample aquatic microhabitats for the snails that transmit schistosome parasites. We found that snail populations vary so much in space and time that snapshots captured through snail sampling (which involved hundreds of person-hours per site!) did not generate a complete picture of the risk that local people face when using these water sources. In fact, environmental proxies within a water access site (such as the area covered by suitable snail habitat) were better at predicting human infection with *S. haematobium* than snail population data. We concluded that using drones and satellite imagery to quickly estimate the geometry and snail habitat coverage of water contact sites is a useful tool for surveillance and control of schistosomiasis.

Building on our conclusion that the area of snail habitat within a water access site was a good proxy of human infection, I led work that integrated ecological data with household survey and interview data to understand the relative contributions of social and environmental factors to risk of infection with *S. haematobium*. We found that the area of snail habitat (or, hazard) was the most important component of becoming infected, compared to water contact behavior (exposure) and access to water and sanitation infrastructure (vulnerability). When considering the intensity of *S. haematobium* infection, water contact behavior was most important. We also found that accounting for the spatial relationship between households and water access sites often improved the fit of our statistical models compared to previously published village-level aggregations of ecological data.

Future work in this area will involve further integration of social, ecological, and spatial data to understand how human interactions with the environment intersect with the parasites circulating through snail populations in water sources.

## Ecological levers for health
Our working group at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/workinggroups/snapp-ecological-levers-health-advancing-priority-agenda-disease-ecology-and) focused on identifying links between infectious disease transmission and environmental change with the goal of synthesizing knowledge on win-win solutions that can benefit people and nature. We developed a framework for distinguishing win-win solutions from other possible outcomes and developed case studies detailing dozens of proposed solutions that we uncovered through a systematic review of the literature. Check out the website that catalogues all of the win-win solutions we've found and reviewed [here](https://jvr782.wixsite.com/leversforhealth)!

As part of this group, I also contributed to an evaluation of the impact of establishing a health clinic near a national park in Indonesian Borneo as a means of keeping people healthy and reducing incentives to engage in illegal logging to pay for catastrophic health expenses. The clinic, which was co-created by the NGOs Alam Sehat Lestari and [Health in Harmony](https://healthinharmony.org/) and the local communities around Gunung Palung National Park, served thousands of people and reduced deforestation by 70% compared to control sites.
