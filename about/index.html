	<p> I grew up in suburban Minneapolis, a land where the unofficial state bird is the mosquito. As an undergraduate, I studied biology and Spanish at the University of Minnesota, Morris, getting my first introductions to public health through a summer research program at Des Moines University and a study abroad program in global health in Costa Rica. It was through these early formative experiences that I became interested in how ecological and social factors influence risk for infectious diseases.

I spent four years living in Atlanta, earning an MPH in global epidemiology and working as a Lead Research Specialist and lab manager, leading the field and lab operations for research on the ecology of mosquito-borne disease in Atlanta. I enjoyed spending time in the field - trapping mosquitoes, collecting samples from avian and mammallian hosts of West Nile virus, processing samples in the lab and engaging undergraduate and graduate student volunteers in this work. As an MPH student, I also spent a summer in the Dominican Republic, working with a multidisciplinary team of graduate students to understand the social and environmental determinants of cholera risk among migrant Haitians and Dominicans.

As a PhD student Stanford, I focused on the human ecology of schistosomiasis in West Africa. Our field	site - the lower basin of the Senegal River - suffers from some of the highest rates of infection in the world, partially due to the ecological changes resulting from dam development in the region. The dams have improved food and economic security in the region, but with the prevalence of <em> Schistosoma haematobium </em> upwards of 60% in school-aged children, the dam's benefits have come at a cost. My research explores this tension between livelihoods and health, using	both quantitative and qualitative data as well as statistical and mathematical modeling.
