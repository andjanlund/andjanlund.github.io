    <p> I am a health and environmental scientist, focused on using data to design, implement and evaluate interventions for infectious diseases. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href = "https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/education/departments/environmental-occupational-health"> Department of Environmental and Occupational Health </a> at the University of Colorado School of Public Health (CSPH) on the Anschutz Medical Campus. My research examines the social and environmental determinants of infectious disease, with a focus on vector- and water-borne diseases. My current work with the <a href = "https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/education/departments/environmental-occupational-health/research/carlton-group/our-team"> Carlton Lab </a> at CSPH is focused on integrating genomic and epidemiologic data to understand the transmisison of a snail-borne parasitic disease (schistosomiasis) in an agricultural region of China. </p>
    
<p> I completed my PhD in the <a href = "https://pangea.stanford.edu/eiper"> Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER) </a> at Stanford University, where my research focused on the human-environment dynamics of schistosomiasis in a dammed landscape in West Africa. Additional work includes the role of <a href = "https://www.sesync.org/project/may-2017-rfp-s-e-synthesis-research-for-graduate-students/integrating-health-impacts-and"> environmental management in disease control </a> and <a href = "https://snappartnership.net/teams/ecological-levers-for-health/"> interventions that address infectious diseases and conservation simultaneously</a>. I have also worked on the ecology of mosquito-borne disease and socio-environmental determinants of diarrheal pathognes. In addition to the PhD, I hold an MPH in global epidemiology from Emory University's <a href = "https://www.sph.emory.edu"> Rollins School of Public Health </a> and a BA in biology and Spanish from the <a href = "https://morris.umn.edu"> University of Minnesota, Morris. </a>
