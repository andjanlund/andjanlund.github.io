    <p> I am an interdisciplinary health and environmental scientist. My research examines the social and environmental determinants of infectious disease. Most recently, I have studied the human-environment dynamics of a snail-borne parasitic disease (schistosomiasis) in a dammed landscapes in West Africa. </p>
    
    <p> I recently finished my PhD in the <a href = "https://pangea.stanford.edu/eiper"> Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER) </a> at Stanford University. I also hold an MPH in global epidemiology from Emory University's <a href = "https://www.sph.emory.edu"> Rollins School of Public Health </a> and a BA in biology and Spanish from the <a href = "https://morris.umn.edu"> University of Minnesota, Morris </a>.
