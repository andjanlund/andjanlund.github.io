    <p> I am an interdisciplinary health and environmental scientist. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href = "https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/education/departments/environmental-occupational-health"> Department of Environmental and Occupational Health </a> at the University of Colorado School of Public Health (CSPH) on the Anschutz Medical Campus. My research examines the social and environmental determinants of infectious disease, and my current work with the <a href = "https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/education/departments/environmental-occupational-health/research/carlton-group/our-team"> Carlton Lab </a> at CSPH is focused on integrating genomic and epidemiologic data to understand the transmisison of a snail-borne parasitic disease (schistosomiasis) in an agriculutural region of China. </p>
    
<p> I completed my PhD in the <a href = "https://pangea.stanford.edu/eiper"> Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER) </a> at Stanford University, where my research focused on the human-environment dynamics of schistosomiasis in a dammed landscape in West Africa, <a href = "https://www.sesync.org/project/may-2017-rfp-s-e-synthesis-research-for-graduate-students/integrating-health-impacts-and" > the role of environmental management in disease control </a> and <a href = "https://snappartnership.net/teams/ecological-levers-for-health/"> interventions that address infectious diseases and conservation simultaneously </a>. I also hold an MPH in global epidemiology from Emory University's <a href = "https://www.sph.emory.edu"> Rollins School of Public Health </a> and a BA in biology and Spanish from the <a href = "https://morris.umn.edu"> University of Minnesota, Morris </a>.
