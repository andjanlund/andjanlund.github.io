<p> I work closely with colleagues at the Centre de Recherche Biomedical – Espoir Pour La Sante, University of California – Santa Barbara and Stanford University to understand how rural and agricultural livelihoods contribute to exposure to schistosome parasites through a variety of water contact activities. I have used qualitative data derived from focus groups to understand local perspectives of disease and the environment and the experience of living in the dammed and endemic landscape along the Senegal River. I have also used household surveys to quantify the relationship between agricultural livelihoods and schistosome infection and combined household survey data with ecological and interview data to understand the relative contributions of social and environmental factors to schistosome risk. Future work in this area will focus on how seasonality influences water contact behavior, how livestock ownership influences human infection risk and assessing the spatial relationships between water sources and human activity space. </p>

<h2> Spatial ecology of schistosome transmission </h2>

<p>In collaboration with colleagues at Stanford University, University of Washington and Centre de Recherche Biomedical – Espoir Pour La Sante, I have contributed to research on the spatial ecology of schistosome transmission along the lower basin of the Senegal River. This work has involved the use of light unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) to identify and sample aquatic microhabitats for the snails that transmit schistosome parasites. We found that snail populations vary so much in space and time that snapshots captured through snail sampling (which involved hundreds of person-hours per site!) does not generate a complete picture of the risk that local people face when using these water sources. In fact, environmental proxies within a water access site (such as the area covered by suitable snail habitat) were better at predicting human infection with S. haematobium than snail population data. We concluded that using drones and satellite imagery to quickly estimate the geometry and snail habitat coverage of water contact sites is a useful tool for surveillance and control of schistosomiasis. </p>

<p> Building on the finding that the area of snail habitat within a water access site is a good proxy of human infection, I have integrated ecological data with household survey and interview data to understand the relative contributions of social and environmental factors to schistosome infection risk. We found that the area of snail habitat (or, hazard) was the most important component of becoming infected with S. haematobium, compared to water contact behavior (exposure) and access to water and sanitation infrastructure (vulnerability), while water contact behavior was the most important component of S. haematobium infection intensity. We also found that accounting for the spatial relationship between households and water access sites often improved the fit of our statistical models compared to village-level aggregations of ecological data. </p>

<p>Future work in this area will involve further integration of social, ecological, and spatial data to understand how human interactions with the environment intersect with the parasites circulating through snail populations in water sources. </p>

<h2> Mitigating disease around dams</h2>

	<p> My research on human livelihoods and schistosomiasis was embedded within a larger project that aimed to implement and evaluate an ecological intervention to control schistosomiasis. Our field sites along the lower basin of the Senegal River suffer a high burden of schistosomiasis in part because of a dam constructed in the 1980s. Dams create an ideal habitat for the snails that transmit schistosomiasis: stabilizing water levels, preventing saltwater intrusion and importantly, disrupting the populations of snail predators. These predators – freshwater prawns – migrate downriver to estuaries to reproduce. When dams block this migration, prawns disappear from upstream reaches of the river and leave snail populations to grow unchecked. </p>
	
	<p> Our research shows that nearly half of the 800 million people at risk for schistosomiasis globally are at increased risk because dams block the migration of snail predators. Along the Senegal River, my qualitative research indicates that people view the dam as beneficial. It improves both food and economic security, but people recognize that these benefits have come at a cost. Most people recognize that the tell-tale signs of schistosomiasis have become common among themselves and their children. Modeling analyses indicate that prawn aquaculture can sustainably improve food production, reduce schistosome transmission and increase revenues for small-scale subsistence agriculture. </p>

<p> Since 2017, I have also co-led work that explores the potential for other ways to mitigate disease around dams. With an interdisciplinary team of graduate students supported by the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC), our team has examined how environmental planning in the Senegal River Basin overlooked the health impacts of dam development. We analyzed documents from the river basin authority’s archive to understand how health impacts were framed and prioritized with respect to the traditional objectives of dam development: food, energy, and water resources. By comparing this framing and prioritization across policy, impact assessment and operational documents, we examined whether and how management policies are put into practice. We found that health impacts of dam development were important effects to be mitigated, but proposals to manage dams for disease control have so far not been adopted in practice. </p>

<p> Future work in this area will include empirical analysis of the impact of prawn aquaculture on snail populations and human infection with schistosomes, collaborative efforts to use hydrological modeling and demonstrate the feasibility of dam management for disease control and eventually develop field studies to understand the impact of dam management schemes on snail and mosquito ecology as well as human infection risk. </p>
