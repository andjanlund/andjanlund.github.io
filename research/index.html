<p> I work closely with colleagues at the Centre de Recherche Biomedical – Espoir Pour La Sante, University of California – Santa Barbara and Stanford University to understand how rural and agricultural livelihoods contribute to exposure to schistosome parasites through a variety of water contact activities. I have used qualitative data derived from focus groups to understand local perspectives of disease and the environment and the experience of living in the dammed and endemic landscape along the Senegal River. I have also used household surveys to quantify the relationship between agricultural livelihoods and schistosome infection and combined household survey data with ecological and interview data to understand the relative contributions of social and environmental factors to schistosome risk. Future work in this area will focus on how seasonality influences water contact behavior, how livestock ownership influences human infection risk and assessing the spatial relationships between water sources and human activity space. </p>

<p>In collaboration with colleagues at Stanford University, University of Washington and Centre de Recherche Biomedical – Espoir Pour La Sante, I have contributed to research on the spatial ecology of schistosome transmission along the lower basin of the Senegal River. This work has involved the use of light unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) to identify and sample aquatic microhabitats for the snails that transmit schistosome parasites. We found that snail populations vary so much in space and time that snapshots captured through snail sampling (which involved hundreds of person-hours per site!) does not generate a complete picture of the risk that local people face when using these water sources. In fact, environmental proxies within a water access site (such as the area covered by suitable snail habitat) were better at predicting human infection with S. haematobium than snail population data. We concluded that using drones and satellite imagery to quickly estimate the geometry and snail habitat coverage of water contact sites is a useful tool for surveillance and control of schistosomiasis. </p>

<p> Building on the finding that the area of snail habitat within a water access site is a good proxy of human infection, I have integrated ecological data with household survey and interview data to understand the relative contributions of social and environmental factors to schistosome infection risk. We found that the area of snail habitat (or, hazard) was the most important component of becoming infected with S. haematobium, compared to water contact behavior (exposure) and access to water and sanitation infrastructure (vulnerability), while water contact behavior was the most important component of S. haematobium infection intensity. We also found that accounting for the spatial relationship between households and water access sites often improved the fit of our statistical models compared to village-level aggregations of ecological data. </p>

<p>Future work in this area will involve further integration of social, ecological, and spatial data to understand how human interactions with the environment intersect with the parasites circulating through snail populations in water sources. </p>
