<p> I work closely with colleagues at the Centre de Recherche Biomedical – Espoir Pour La Sante, University of California – Santa Barbara and Stanford University to understand how rural and agricultural livelihoods contribute to exposure to schistosome parasites through a variety of water contact activities. I have used qualitative data derived from focus groups to understand local perspectives of disease and the environment and the experience of living in the dammed and endemic landscape along the Senegal River. I have also used household surveys to quantify the relationship between agricultural livelihoods and schistosome infection and combined household survey data with ecological and interview data to understand the relative contributions of social and environmental factors to schistosome risk. Future work in this area will focus on how seasonality influences water contact behavior, how livestock ownership influences human infection risk and assessing the spatial relationships between water sources and human activity space. </p>
